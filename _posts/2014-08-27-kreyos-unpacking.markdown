Once upon a Time, there was a crowd funding campaign for ["The next Generation Smartwatch"](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/kreyos-the-only-smartwatch-with-voice-gesture-control)
<p>After Pepple and Sony SW2 it should be the next big Smartwatch. But there was a Problem....</p>
<p>...another one...</p>
<p>...not again....</p>
<p>...really?...</p>
<p>More than a Year after the Campain ended with the 15x of the planned Goal, the Smartwatch arrived.</p>
<p>Here, I will show you some unpacking and first Impressions of this glorious product:</p>

<p>After fully unpacking all Items, you have to charge with the included Charging Adapter</p>

<p>First App Start</p>
<p>The Android App looks really beautiful. NOT!</p>

<p>To connect your Kreyos with the Android Device, you have to try it really hard. Paired in the System Bluetooth Settings, you have to pair it again, in the App 2-3 times, until the App recognises the Device.</p>

<p>I don't have to explain every Screenshot. Why the Firmware Download wasn't successfully is a mystery. The Path to the Image is already correct [2]</p>
<p>Right after the User confirm the Error Dialog, another "Check for Update" Screen opens and the Kreyos will be flashed. But no, the Update wasn't complete.</p>
<p>When the Update Dialog finished, the Watch wouldn't restart. This is a known Bug [3]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will post more in the next days.</p>
