Bluetooth is a wireless technology wich is classified in [IEEE 802.15](http://www.techstreet.com/ieee/subgroups/38372) more precise in<br />
[IEEE 802.15.1 (Deprecated Version 2002)](http://www.techstreet.com/ieee/products/1826990)<br />
[IEEE 802.15.1 (Current Version 2005)](http://www.techstreet.com/ieee/products/1802286)<br />
<br />

<p>After a researchers team at Ericsson Mobile Communications initiated a feasibility study to analyse short-range / low-power wireless<br />
connectivity as a way of elimination cables between mobile phones and computers it was developed into the Bluetooth technology.</p>

IEEE 802.15 specifies wireless personal area network [(WPAN)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15#Task_Group_1:_WPAN_.2F_Bluetooth). Group 1 is based on Bluetooth technology wich defines physical layer (PHY) and Media Access Control (MAC) for wireless connectivity. 
<br />

In the First 10 Years approximately 1,5 Billion bluetooth chips were integrated by their manufacturers.<br />
The Bluetooth [Special Interest Group (SIG)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Special_Interest_Group) saves the position with lots of Changes and Updates of the IEEE standard. SIG was founded by<br />
<br />

Ericsson, IBM, Intel, Nokia and Toshiba in September 1998. [More members joined in December 1999](http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/bluetooth-security-review-part-1): 3Com Corporation, Lucent Technologies, Microsoft Corporation and Mororola Inc.<br />
The First Release was Version 1.0a in July 1999.
<br />

<p>The Bluetooth logo is a merge of two Runic Letters. First one is SHORT-TWIG-HAGALL U+16BD and the Runic Letter BERKANAN BEORC BJARKAN U+16D2.<br />
<br />

Second one stands for the initials of [King Harald Blåtand Gormsen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_Bluetooth). Wich unified Denmark and Norway much like the technology whose goal was to unify computers and cellular phones.<br />
